    **Units**

    The fundamental units are mass, length, time and temperature.
    Temperatures must be specified in Kelvin.
    For all other magnitudes involved, a consistent set of units has to be used.

Heat Pump
***********
The model of the heat pump requires the following paramreters:

:math:`T_\text{steam}` 
    Temperature of the steam

:math:`T_\text{source}` 
    Temperature of the source

:math:`T_\text{pinch_source}` 
    Pinch temperature of the source (temperature different between the source and the refrigerant)
	
:math:`T_\text{pinch_steam}` 
    Pinch temperature of the steam (temperature different between the steam and the refrigerant)
