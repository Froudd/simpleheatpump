Motivation
----------

The motivation behind this project is to be able to compare the cost of different systems either with a standard gas boiler or with a innovative solution using a steam-generating heat pump. Furthermore, as the Brauhaus in Schaan [website]_ is closed to both the line and the return lines of the heating network, this project will analysis the technicality and the economic of both lines as the heat source for the heat pump.
