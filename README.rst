Overview
================

This simulation is for the Brauhaus Liechstenstein in Schaan [website]_ project 2023.




Goal
*****

The goal is to simulated a steam generating heat pump using one of two possibles heat sources. The first one is the heating network coming directly from the KVA Buchs and the second is the return heating network which goes first to different industries in Schaan like HILTI which means that the temperature in winter is lower.

Steps
*******

1 Use hourly data of temperature and prices of heating network (hot and cold), electricity price, process demand  
2 Selecting which heat source is used  
3 Modeling a simple heat pump  
4 Using the process demand to run the heat pump and calulcate the electricity needed  
5 Get the operating cost (heat + electricity)  
6 Compare it to the gas cost  
7 Analyse the CO2 production of the solutions & the current system.
